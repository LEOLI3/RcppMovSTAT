Description: This is a package providing several efficient functions to 
    calculate common moving(or rolling, running) statitics for both EVENLY and UNEVENLY SPACED Time 
    Series: moving average, moving median, and moving maximum(minimum) . Built on C++, these 
    functions would be apparently more efficient than those written in traditional R and also faster
    than Others written by Rcpp.
