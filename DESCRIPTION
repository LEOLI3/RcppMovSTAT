Description: This is a package providing several efficient functions to 
    calculate common moving (or rolling, running) statistics for both EVENLY and UNEVENLY SPACED Time 
    Series: moving average, moving median, and moving maximum(minimum). Built on C++, these 
    functions are apparently more efficient than those written in traditional R and also faster
    than Others written using package Rcpp.
