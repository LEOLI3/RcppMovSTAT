# RcppMovStat

This is just a package providing several efficient functions to 
calculate common moving(or rolling, running) statitics.Built on C++, the functions 
become apparently more efficient than those written in traditional R.
    
Install me with devtools:

    install_github("LEOLI3/RcppMovStat")
